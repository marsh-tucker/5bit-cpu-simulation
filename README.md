# 5-bit CPU Simulation (NI Multisim)

This project showcases a custom 5-bit CPU architecture designed and simulated entirely in NI Multisim. The design replicates key components found in real-world CPUs, including a memory system, control logic, and execution cycle. The instruction set is based loosely on the MARIE architecture and supports simple fetch-decode-execute logic.

## Architecture Overview

The design includes the following major components:

- Instruction Register (IR)
- Memory Address Register (MAR)
- Accumulator (AC)
- Memory Buffer Register (MBR)
- Multiplexer and Decoder Logic
- ALU and Output Bus

All subsystems were wired and configured manually, with logical control lines and memory locations verified using program data.
